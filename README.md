# Data Cleaning with Pandas

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to clean and prepare raw datasets for analysis using **Python** and the **Pandas** library.  
The notebook focuses on transforming messy, inconsistent data into a structured format suitable for further analysis or visualization.

## Objectives
- Handle missing values and duplicates.
- Standardize column names and data types.
- Apply filtering, grouping, and transformation operations.
- Use Pandas functions to streamline the cleaning workflow.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `Data Cleaning with Pandas.ipynb` → main notebook with code and explanations.
- (Optional) `sample_data.csv` → example dataset used in the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.  
3. Run the cells step by step to reproduce the cleaning process.  

## Key Takeaways
This project illustrates best practices for data cleaning in Python, such as:
- Identifying and handling missing data.
- Removing outliers and irrelevant columns.
- Applying transformations to improve data quality.
